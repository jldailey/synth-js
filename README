Generate HTML from minimal expressions.

These expressions look like CSS selectors, are multi-line,
and tab-delimited. Any arrangment of \r\n is considered a newline,
while only \t is considered to be an indent.

Example:

html
	head
		meta[charset=utf-8]
		title "Home Page"
	body
		div.container#main
			p "Hello World"

Notice the parts that are not like CSS selectors: the strict
indentation, and the "quoted" text (which creates text nodes in the
output).


How To Use:

In NodeJS:
	synth = require("synth-js/synth").synth
	fragment = synth('a[href=/home] "Click here to win"')

In a browser:

<script src=".../synth.js"></script>
<script>
	var fragment = synth("a[href=/home] 'Home Page'");
	document.body.appendChild(fragment);
</script>
